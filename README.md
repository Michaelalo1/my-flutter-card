# My Card

## My Goal

Here I am going to showcase my knowledge on how to design user interfaces for Flutter apps.

## What I will create

My Card is a personal business card. Imagine every time I wanted to give someone my contact details or my business card but you didn't have it on me. Well, now I can get them to download my business card as an app.

## What I implemented

* Creation of Stateless Widgets
* Using Containers to lay out my UI
* Using Columns and Rows to position my UI elements
* Adding custom fonts
* Adding Material icons
* Styling Text widgets
* Reading and using Flutter Documentation
